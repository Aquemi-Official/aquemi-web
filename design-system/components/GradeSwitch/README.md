GradeSwitch sets a short grade table as a selector panel: one strip per product, a selector with one slot per water grade, the knob in the minimum and a dashed open slot where your specification may call for more.

- On the site: a `table` block with `"as": "grades"` and `"look": "grade-switch"` (renderer `assets/src/blocks/look-grade-switch.js`); used on ind-pharma (natural health products). Origin: no concept of its own (quota); adapted from sys-pw.4 (tactile option tags) and 50-concept-limit-gauges (instrument selector).
- Markup: plain section (page ground; it follows DecisionPlant) → `div.aq-grade-switch` (the plate, four `span.__screw`, `p.__colh`) → `ol.__rows` of `li.__row` → `div.__prod` (index, `h3.__t` Geist Light 26/32), `div.__sw` (aria-hidden: `span.__track` with `span.__slot` per grade, `.is-on` / `.is-alt`, and `span.__knob`; `span.__ticks`), `div.__txt` (`p.__min` with mono label, `p.__note`).
- Fields: `cols`, `rows` [product, minimum, note]. Added: `positions` [{id, t}] (slots, left to right), `switch` [["potable", "pw?"], …] per row (`?` = where your specification or the monograph calls for it).
- Tokens: plate `surface-raised` with a `line-strong` hairline on the page ground, track `surface-sunken`, knob `navy` with `on-navy` label, open slot dashed `flow`. The minimum water is the accent: Geist Light 22/28 in `flow` (pass 9b ind-pharma.4: the grade set in steel blue). The selector is a picture of the row; the words carry the meaning.
- Phones: name, selector, then the words, stacked.

## Motion

The plate is screwed down (screws turn a quarter), the strips wipe in, and on each the knob travels from the first slot to the minimum grade and settles home (aq-settle, no bounce); open slots trace in last. Once on scroll-in, under 3.5 s; nothing under reduced motion.
