WitnessPlan sets the ways to witness a FAT as ruled rows whose leader lines run into the package standing in the test bay; choosing a way lights its leader, marker and part (look `witness-plan`, options block).

Concept: pass 9b svc-fat-sat.3 (five witness modes as ruled rows with mono numerals whose leaders run into one white PP skid in its frame).

## Markup
`<section class="aq-section aq-witness-plan-sec">` > `.aq-witness-plan` > `__side` (section head, `ol.__list` > `li.__ind` (aria-hidden indicator) and `li` > `button.__opt[data-i][data-part][aria-pressed]` with `__n`, `__t`, `__d`), `__fig` > `__sheet` (IsoKit svg `.__svg` with the bay frame `__bay`, HTML `span.__zone.is-bay|is-cam`, `span.__mk[data-i]` markers), and `svg.__leads` (aria-hidden; `path.__lead[data-i]` laid out by the look's script from the rendered rows; `window.AQwitness.lay/show`).

## Fields
`h`, `intro`, `items` [{`t`, `d`, `part`}], `zones` [bay label, remote label] (short drawing labels, aria-hidden). `part`: "panel", "camera", "gauge", "documents", "analyzer", "ro" or "tank" (default "ro").

## Rules
- IsoKit light drawing (white PP package: skid, RO rack, tank, panel, analyser, gauge, binders; the camera drawn inline) inside the bay's open frame in `line-strong`.
- Leaders are each row's underline carried into the drawing to the marker, 1 px `line-strong`; the chosen one 1.5 px `flow`, its marker filled `flow`, its part lit.
- Arrow keys, Home and End move between the ways and choose. Under 1080 px the drawing sits between the heading and the rows, leaders off; numbers pair rows and parts.

## Motion
The IsoKit drawing plays, rows rise, leaders draw out of their rows and a light runs each one to its part as its marker strikes (animated-beam port); the first way stays chosen. Choosing a way sends one light down its leader; the raised indicator springs between rows (sliding-tabs port). Once, under 4.5 s; nothing under reduced motion.
