HoldTimeline draws a sequence of stages with hold points as nodes on one rising line across a pale engraved macro close-up of a fused pipe joint, each stage's duration and deliverables hung off its node.

Pass 9 look `hold-timeline` (`assets/src/blocks/look-hold-timeline.js`), set with `"look": "hold-timeline"` on a `steps` block. Without the look the block renders as ProcessSteps. First used on services ("How long each stage takes, and what it leaves").

## Fields

- `items[]`: `t` "<stage>, <duration>" (the last comma outside `[]` and `()` splits it), `d` what the stage leaves, optional `hold` (who signs: "Your quality unit"), optional `link` (page or page#anchor; the stage name becomes the link).
- A duration with a `[placeholder]` shows as a mono line with its chip; a stated one with a number ("at least 12 months") becomes the section's boxed figure.
- `macro` (optional): `false` drops the pipe close-up.

## Rules

- Light ground (pass 9 polish): the section follows the page theme; on services it sits on the alternate ground between the navy router and the FAQ, so the page has one loud section. A stated duration renders as the boxed figure with its number set large and light (`__num`).
- The macro is decoration in line art only: a fused pipe drawn huge and cropped (engraving lines closer together towards the edges give it its round body), the weld bead across it, water as a dashed `flow` centre line. No raster, no gradient.
- Geometry: odd stages hang above-left of their node, even ones below-right; `--w` (callout width) and each `--x` (node position) are chosen per item count so same-side callouts never touch and the line never crosses text. Best for 3 to 7 stages.
- A hold point is a ringed node and a "Hold point" stamp naming who signs.
- Phones: one vertical `flow` line down the left with the stages along it; the macro stays as a faint ground.
- Hover a stage: its node swells and its pole turns `flow`.

## Motion

Motion: the macro comes into focus (scale and fade), its engraving lines draw from the weld seam outwards, the bead rings on and the water creeps once; then a flow drop runs the rising line from the left edge, laying it behind it, and each node lands as the drop arrives, its pole growing and the callout unrolling from the node. At a hold point the drop waits a beat, the ring opens and the stamp strikes; the boxed figure counts up; the drop leaves at the top right and rests there (under 5 s, once). Phones land each stage as it scrolls in. Nothing under reduced motion.

Ported (pass 9b): Subframe Motion "Cue scrubber" (cue-scrubber): the stages are seekable chapters. Pointing at or focusing into a stage sends the water node by node to it (120 ms legs), empties the line beyond and steps the stages still ahead back; leaving lets it run on to the top. Wide screens.
