WalkdownPins sets IQ and OQ checks as a table beside the installed system they inspect, each check's number on its part and a few parts called out by name (look `walkdown-pins`, spec block).

Concept: pass 9b svc-cq.2 (checks table left, isometric skid right labelled at the spots the checks inspect); before that compliance.3 and sys-pw.3, drawn with IsoKit on a light sheet.

## Markup
`<section class="aq-section aq-walkdown-pins-sec">` > section head, `.aq-walkdown-pins` > `__tab` (`__cols` column head, aria-hidden, and the fold wrapping `ol.__list` > `li.__row[data-row][data-lit][tabindex=0]` (`__n`, `h3.__t` with `__tag--iq|oq`, `p.__v`, `p.__m`)) and `__fig` > `__sheet` (IsoKit svg with `isoSheet` and leader callouts `g.__lead`, HTML `span.__lab[data-part]` names and `span.__pin[data-row]` number markers placed by `isoPct`).

## Fields
As a spec block: `cols`, `rows` [{`p`, `v`, `m`, `part`}], `labels` {part: short drawing name} (leader callouts, aria-hidden), `fold`, `fold_noun`. `p` "IQ · Joints" splits into the tag and the name. `part`: "branch", "joint", "analyzer", "coldest", "outlets", "panel", "skid", "gauge" (the drawing anchor and the parts that light); default "skid". Two markers on one part step apart.

## Rules
- Table 6 of 12 (number in flow mono, check, what we verify, basis in mono), sheet 6 of 12 and sticky. IQ tags ruled in `ink` (installed), OQ tags filled `flow` (running).
- Markers are small ruled squares with mono numbers; callout names mono 12 px over their shelves, stacked apart per side.
- Pointing at or focusing a row lights its parts (`is-lit`), its marker and its callout.
- Under 1080 px the sheet sits above the table; phones drop the column head and callouts (numbers pair rows and parts); the fold applies on phones only.

## Motion
The installed system draws and the water runs the loop once (IsoKit choreography), then the markers strike onto their parts in check order and the callout names fade in (no bounce). Once, under 5 s.
