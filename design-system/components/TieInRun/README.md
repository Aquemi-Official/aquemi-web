TieInRun tells ordered steps on one sticky drawing of a qualified loop gaining a new outlet: as the steps pass, the outlet is planned, its change boundary ruled, the branch built and tied in, and the water released into it.

- On the site: a `steps` block with `"look": "tie-in-run"` (renderer `assets/src/blocks/look-tie-in-run.js`); used on ind-cdmo ("From signed program to released water"). Concept: pass 9b ind-cdmo.3 (four numbered mono steps beside a line drawing), with the log's note: the new outlet being tied in, not a generic module ring.
- Drawing: IsoKit (`outlet` × 3, `valve`, pipes): the loop header with two existing points of use; the new branch (tee, isolation valve, drop, sample point, point of use) in `g.__new`; the change boundary `path.__cc` on the floor. Polypropylene Purified Water only.
- Markup: `div.aq-tie-in-run[data-stage]` (two columns) → `ol.__steps` of `li.__step` (`span.__n`, `h3.__t`, `p.__d`; Geist Mono), `div.__fig` (sticky) → `div.__plate` (aria-hidden: `svg.aq-iso`, `span.__mk` per stage, numbered).
- Fields: `h`, `intro`, `items` [{t, d, link}]. The first four steps drive the drawing's stages (plan, boundary, build, release). Placeholders stay Placeholder chips.
- Stage values: `--p0`…`--p3` on the root (0–1, 1 at rest): the new branch's opacity, the boundary's opacity, the branch's dash gap and fill, and (in motion.js) the water drawn into it. Without script or under reduced motion the drawing shows the finished, released state.
- Tokens: steps `ink` / `ink-muted`, numerals `ink-subtle`, the step on the reading line `flow`; new branch and boundary `flow`; markers `surface` on `line-strong`, the current one `flow`. Heading Geist Light 56/60 (36/40 on phones).
- Phones: the drawing rides as a sticky band under the nav (narrower plate, `surface` ground, rule below), the steps scroll beneath it.

## Motion

The page's one scroll-linked story (scrubbed, never pinned). Ported from Subframe Motion "Scroll-driven image reveal" (scroll-window): one scroll progress (the steps list passing 60 % of the viewport) fanned into staggered stage phases, phase = smoothstep((p − i/n) · n · 1.24); the step on the reading line and its marker take the flow colour, the others quiet to 0.55. Nothing under reduced motion.
