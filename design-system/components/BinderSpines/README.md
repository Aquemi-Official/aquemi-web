BinderSpines sets an evidence table (who inspects, what they read, where we answer it) as ring binders standing on a QA shelf, one binder per inspector, the clause each one cites set large on its spine, beside a large drawing of the plant they inspect bleeding off the page.

- On the site: a `table` block with `"as": "evidence"` and `"look": "binder-spines"` (renderer `assets/src/blocks/look-binder-spines.js`); used on ind-pharma. Origin: no concept of its own (quota); adapted from compliance.2.v2 (tactile records) and 51-concept-turnover-binder.
- Markup: `div.aq-binder-spines` (`.has-plant`: grid, binders 8 / plant 4) → `div.__fig` (IsoKit `svg.__svg`: RO rack on its skid, panel, tank, loop pump, UV, two points of use, analyser, the return; `--drop` puts its floor line on the shelf; the figure runs to the page edge and crops), `ol.__row` of `li.__book` (`.is-lime` alternates) → `span.__cap` ×2, `div.__label` (paper label holder: mono key, `h3.__who`), `div.__read` (`p.__code` Geist Mono Light 26/30, `p.__d`), `span.__hole` (finger hole), `a.__go` (where we answer it); then `span.__shelf`. Book heights vary a little (`--h`, decorative).
- Fields: `cols`, `rows` [who, read, {t, link, intent}], `fold`, `fold_noun` (phones only). Added: `plant` (default true; false drops the drawing), `spines` [{code, read}] per row: the clause shown large and the reading without it (a recast of the row's own words; without it the whole reading shows).
- Tokens: binders `navy` / `limestone`, label `surface-raised` with a `line` inner frame, shelf `navy`. Hover/focus: the binder lifts out of the row.
- Under 1100 px the plant is a cropped band above the shelf. Phones: binders lie flat as stacked bands (finger hole at the right), fold back on. The plant bleeding off the right edge comes from pass 9b ind-pharma.2.
- Note: cmp-documentation's SpineShelf also shows binder spines (the turnover package); keep the two off the same page.

## Motion

The plant draws itself (IsoKit choreography, the water once round the loop), the shelf runs out from the left, then the binders are filed onto it one by one (each drops into place with a slight tilt and settles), the paper label prints in, the clause decodes, the reading and the answer follow. Once on scroll-in, under 4.5 s; folded binders left alone; nothing under reduced motion.
