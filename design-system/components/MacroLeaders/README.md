MacroLeaders sets a comparison table beside a macro drawing (RO membrane leaves fanned over a PP pipe and its weld bead) and calls each row out from it with a numbered marker and a leader, so a by-industry table reads as one piece of equipment serving every row.

- Look: `"look": "macro-leaders"` on a `table` block (renderer `assets/src/blocks/look-macro-leaders.js`). Fields as the table block: `cols` (first is the row name), `rows` (cells, strings or `{t, link}`). No new fields.
- Markup: `.aq-macro-leaders` > `figure.aq-macro-leaders__fig` (aria-hidden svg, `preserveAspectRatio="xMaxYMid slice"`, bleeding off the viewport's left edge) and `table.aq-macro-leaders__table` (explicit ARIA table roles, since phones change its display). The row name cell holds `.aq-macro-leaders__lead` (aria-hidden leader with its `.aq-macro-leaders__mk` marker) and `.aq-macro-leaders__name`; value cells hold an `.aq-macro-leaders__k` label shown on phones only.
- Leader length per row is `--k` (0 to 1, set by the renderer from the row's place), so the markers stand on an arc.
- The drawing uses flat tonal fills only (`surface-raised`, `surface-sunken`, `flow-tint`, an 18 % `ink` mix for the pipe's shaded side), `line-strong` edges, `line` hatching (permeate carrier, feed spacer mesh) and `flow` water lines. No gradients. Two short mono drawing labels.
- Row names in Geist Light 24 px; values 14 px; header in mono. Hover or focus within a row tints it `flow-tint` (the table's one highlighted row) and fills its marker and leader in `flow`.
- Phones: the macro is a band above the table; rows are records on a vertical rail of markers, each value with its column label.
- Not for tables of more than about eight rows (the arc crowds), or without a first column that names the rows.

Motion (`motion.js`): the leaves start pressed together and fan apart back to front, the pipe slides in along its axis and the weld bead swells, water runs once along each leaf; then row by row the marker pops onto its arc, the leader shoots to the row and the cells arrive as it lands (about 3.4 s). Nothing under reduced motion.
