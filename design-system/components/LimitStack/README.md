LimitStack sets a page's water-quality limits as an editorial type stack beside a sculpted outlet pipe, so the reader sees each limit large, its reference, and the guaranteed skid-outlet value as the stack's last, boxed step.

- On the site: a `spec` block with `"look": "limit-stack"` (renderer `assets/src/blocks/look-limit-stack.js`). Origin: pass 9 concept `research/pass9/concepts/sys-pw.0.png` (oversized headline, stepped limits, pipe loop with a Guaranteed band).
- Markup: `<section class="aq-section aq-band--limestone aq-limit-stack-sec">` → `<div class="aq-limit-stack">` with `__text` (the section head at display scale with the caption beside the heading, `ol.__list` of `li.__row` stepped by `--i`, the note) and `figure.__fig` (an IsoKit svg on the limestone ground, `__seal` and `__outlet` lettering skewed onto the iso face, `figcaption.__note` holding the block intro).
- Row: `p.__p` (index, mono label, an "Action level" chip from `level`), `p.__v` (limit `__n`, unit `__u`, qualifier `__q`, split by `gaugeParse` from blocks/spec.js; a placeholder value prints whole as `__n--open`), `p.__m` (a hairline `__rule` that runs towards the drawing, then the reference).
- Fields: `h`, `caption` (beside the heading), `intro` (the note on the pipe), `rows [{p, v, m, hl, level}]`, `note`. A row whose `p` says "guaranteed" or "outlet" is the boxed hero step (`is-hero`: flow border on `surface-raised`); `hl` puts the index in flow.
- Tokens: limestone ground, `on-limestone` / `on-limestone-muted` text, Geist Light display heading, Geist Mono limits, `navy` collar, `flow` water. The figure is sticky beside the stack on desktop.
- Phones: head, drawing, stack; steps shrink to `space-3`; the reference rules become top hairlines.
- Use it for one short list of limits (up to six) with a guaranteed value; for many parameters use ParamTiles or SpecTable.

## Motion

Motion: one timeline when the stack scrolls in. Each row steps in from the left a beat after the one above (index decodes, the limit rises out of its line, the reference rule runs out towards the drawing); the pipe draws through `AQiso.timeline`, the water runs in at the top, round the coil and down the outlet run; when it reaches the collar the "Guaranteed" lettering wraps on, the guaranteed row flashes `flow-tint` and the note appears. Under 5 s; nothing under reduced motion.
