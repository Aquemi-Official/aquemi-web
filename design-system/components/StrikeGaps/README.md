StrikeGaps sets gaps and their fixes as a before and after in large light type: the gap as it stands, struck through like a drawing revision; the requirement it misses in mono on an arrow; what the upgrade does at full strength.

Look `strike-gaps` (`assets/src/blocks/look-strike-gaps.js`) on a `table` block with `as: "failures"` (gap, requirement, fix). Used on svc-upgrades, "Data integrity gaps in older controls". Concept adapted: 43-concept-failures (numbered failure rows with what we design in), opened up as kinetic editorial type.

- Markup: `div.aq-strike-gaps` > `__heads` (column names, aria-hidden) + `ol.__rows` > `li.__row` (`.aq-index`, `p.__was` (`__k`, `__wt` struck), `p.__req` (`__k`, `__rt`, `__arrow` with `__shaft`, `__tip`), `p.__now` (`__k`)). `__k` are visually hidden column labels for screen readers.
- Fields: `h`, `intro`, `cols`, `rows`, `fold`, `fold_noun`. The intro (the discontinued controllers) is set as a mono side note beside the headline on a `flow` hairline (pass 9b concept svc-upgrades.2); phones put it under the headline.
- Tokens: gap Geist 300 28 px in `ink-muted` with an `ink` line-through; requirement mono 13 px; arrow `flow`; fix Geist 300 28 px in `ink`.
- Phones: each row stacks: struck gap, the requirement beside a short down arrow, the fix.

Motion: row by row as they scroll in: the gap is set and its strike darkens through it, the arrow runs out, the fix is inserted word by word at its end (sentence-diff-motion: each word rises 12 px, 260 ms, cubic-bezier(.22,.72,.15,1)). Once per row, about 1.6 s. Hover dims the gap and turns the fix flow.
