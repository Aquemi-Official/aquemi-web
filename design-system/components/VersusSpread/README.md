VersusSpread sets a FAT versus SAT table as an editorial spread: a navy mast with the heading at display scale, the numbered comparison table, and one line drawing of the installed system whose parts light for the test being read (look `versus-spread`, table block `as: "versus"`).

Concept: pass 9b `svc-fat-sat.0` (editorial magazine spread: an oversized light headline on a navy block cropped by the page edge, a hairline comparison sheet, one line-drawn loop as the only figure). The loop became a real elevation of the system with the two test boundaries, so the figure explains the table.

## Markup
`<section class="aq-section aq-versus-spread-sec">` > `.aq-in` > `.aq-versus-spread` > `__mast[data-theme=dark]` (`__top` aria-hidden: nav label and count; the section head), `figure.__fig` (`__art`: the svg with `g.__part[data-p]`, `rect.__bound--sat`, `rect.__bound--fat[data-p=fat]`, and two HTML `__tag`s; `figcaption.__now` aria-hidden: `__count`, `__now-t`), `__body` (the fold wrapper with `__table[role=table]` > `__hrow` (column headers) and `__rows[role=rowgroup]` > `__lens` and `__row[role=row][tabindex=0][data-i][data-parts]` (`__test` with `__n`, `__tn`; two `__c` cells with a phone-only `__k` key); then `__end`, the conclusion row, `data-parts="fat"`).

## Fields
As a versus table: `cols` [test, FAT label, SAT label] (the labels also tag the boundaries), `rows` [[test, FAT, SAT]] (strings or {t, link}), `conclusion` [label, FAT side, SAT side], `fold`, `fold_noun` (fold on phones only). New, optional: `row_parts`, one string per row, the drawing parts the test covers, space-separated, any of `skid ro pump panel inst valve pipe tank loop pou util`.

## Rules
- Mast: `navy`, bleeds off the left edge (a pseudo-element), heading light 300 at `clamp(52px, 6.6cqi, 92px)`. Phone: full bleed both sides, 44 px.
- Table: hairline rules, mono row numbers, sans test names; a cell starting "Not possible" gets a dashed `line-strong` left rule and `ink-subtle`. Conclusion: 1.5 px ink rule, the reuse label as a navy tile.
- Drawing: flat elevation, 1.5 px `line-strong`, pipes as a double wall with a `flow` water line. Lit parts turn `flow` with a `flow-tint` fill, the others step back to 0.32. The FAT boundary is long-dashed, the site's dotted. Tags are HTML (12 px mono), aria-hidden: the table carries the words.
- Pointing at or focusing a row (rows are focusable) lights its parts and names it under the drawing; it works without GSAP and under reduced motion (renderer).
- Phone: mast, drawing (not sticky), rows stacked with "FAT, our test bay" / "SAT, your site" keys; the fold applies.

## Motion
The mast slides in from the page edge; the boundaries fade up, equipment and pipe walls draw, the water runs skid piping, riser and loop; rows follow. Then the page's one scroll-linked story (desktop): a reading lens, ported from Subframe Motion `reading-lens` (MIT): the row at a focus line 45 % down the viewport is in focus, a flow-tint band springs behind it (core spring 460 / 34), its parts light and the caption reads "03 / 07 Sanitization"; rows further away fall to strength 1 - (d - 1) * 0.14, floor 0.6. Never pins; reduced motion: no lens.
