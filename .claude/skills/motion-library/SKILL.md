description: Find, port and ship motion for the Aquemi site from the Subframe Motion library (309 MIT React/WebGL examples - shaders, scroll stories, counters, buttons, diagrams) into our vanilla JS + GSAP stack and design tokens. Use when someone asks for an animation, a hover or press effect, a scroll reveal, a shader or ambient background, "more motion", "use Subframe", or to make a section feel alive; also before writing any new motion.js from scratch.

# Motion library: Subframe Motion → Aquemi

Subframe Motion (https://www.subframe.com/motion) is a library of 309 open-source (MIT) motion examples in three
categories: Components & interactions, Animation & motion, WebGL & shaders. The examples are React (some need the
`motion` package) or raw WebGL. Our site is vanilla JS, GSAP 3.13 and design tokens, so we **port** examples: keep
their motion mechanism and values, rewrite the shell.

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| MCP server (Claude Code loads it from the repo's `.mcp.json`) | `subframe-motion` → `https://mcp.subframe.com/motion/mcp`, no account. Tools: `search_motion_examples`, `get_motion_example`, `get_motion_guidance` |
| Same calls without the MCP (subagents, scripts) | `python .claude/skills/motion-library/tools/motion.py search "<words>" \| get <slug> --out <dir> \| guide <topics> \| catalog` |
| Every example: slug, category, runtime, look, description | `catalog.json` (next to this file; refresh with `motion.py catalog`) |
| What we ported, where it lives | the table below (keep it current) |
| Our WebGL runtime (ambient layers) | `assets/src/motion/gl.js` (`AQgl.def`, `AQgl.scan`) + component `FxShader` |
| Our GSAP layer | `assets/src/motion/core.js` (`AQmotion.fx`, helpers `m.on`, `m.tw`, `m.claim`, `m.split`, `m.count`…) |

## Finding the right example

1. Say what the section must explain, then what should move (atlas and brand book first: steady flow, hairline,
   navy/limestone, one steel-blue accent). Search in plain words, several phrasings; filter `--runtime webgl` or
   `--category`. Browse `catalog.json` by `look` when the words don't hit.
2. `get <slug> --out <scratch dir>`: read `motion`, `adapt` (names the code that drives the motion), `reducedMotion`,
   `limitations`, `packages`, `assets`, `license`. Read `guide adapting` once, and `scroll` / `ambient` /
   `text-and-numbers` / `feedback` for that kind of effect.
3. Reject examples that need photos or assets we don't have, or that would read as consumer/playful (stickers,
   physics toys, emoji, audio). Never stainless/chrome/brushed-metal looks: Aquemi is polypropylene only.

## Porting rules

- **Keep:** the mechanism (the shader, the spring or easing values, the stagger, the geometry), its reduced-motion
  branch and keyboard behaviour, and the MIT licence header (paste it at the top of the ported block with
  `Ported from Subframe Motion "<title>" (<slug>), MIT, (c) 2026 Subframe`).
- **Replace:** React state with DOM + GSAP (`gsap.to`, `quickTo` for pointer-follow, `ScrollTrigger` for
  scroll-linked, `Flip` for layout moves, `SplitText` for type); `motion` springs with GSAP eases of the same feel
  (`aq-settle`, `power3.out`, `elastic` never); demo colours with tokens (CSS `var(--flow)` in DOM, `colors:{u_x:'flow'}`
  in shaders); demo copy with the section's real copy.
- **WebGL:** one fragment shader per effect, registered with `AQgl.def('<name>', {frag, colors, uniforms, still,
  pointer, scale})` in the component's `motion.js` (runs before `AQmotion.fx`). Markup: host gets `aq-fx-host`,
  first child `<canvas class="aq-fx-shader" data-gl="<name>" aria-hidden="true">`. Multi-pass simulations
  (feedback buffers) need an AQgl extension; prefer single-pass analytic shaders.
- **Where the code goes:** a section's effect in that look's `design-system/components/<Look>/motion.js` (+ style.css);
  a site-wide effect in the shared component (Button, RelatedLinks, FAQ…) or `core.js`. Never add React, the `motion`
  package or another library.
- Tokens only in CSS; the design-system check must report 0 problems.

## Motion rules (brand book, Motion)

- **Scroll-triggered reveals** play once and settle within 5 s; travel ≤ 16 px for text.
- **Visitor-driven feedback** (hover, press, drag, scrub) may repeat; 100–200 ms for hover/press, exits a third faster.
- **Ambient layers** (FxShader): only while on screen, only the most visible one moves, one visible cycle ≥ 6 s, faint
  behind text, a still frame under reduced motion, at most two per page.
- **One pinned or scroll-linked story per page**: readable at every scroll position, skippable, never hijacks scroll
  speed, static layout under reduced motion.
- Nothing runs under `prefers-reduced-motion` except still frames and essential state changes.
- Verify with `research/tools/motioncheck.js <page> 1280` and `375` (0 errors, nothing left hidden) and watch the loud
  one with `film.js`.
